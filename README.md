# Attrition Analysis Streamlit APP

This Streamlit app is designed to predict the attrition of new employees by filling out a form and running that information through an Easy Ensemble Classifier model to predict if an employee will leave the company and the probability of it.

This app is tied to my Ironhack bootcamp final project, that you can acces from here: [HR Analysis] (https://github.com/Raughar/hr-analysis)
